# AI-Powered Paris Travel Guide

Welcome to the AI-Powered Paris Travel Guide, developed for Peterman Reality Tours. This project leverages OpenAI's API to create a virtual Parisian expert, offering insightful and concise answers to common travel questions about Paris.

## Project Overview

The travel guide uses advanced AI to provide users with valuable information about Paris's iconic landmarks and hidden gems. By interacting with the guide, users can receive well-informed responses to their pre-defined questions, making travel planning seamless and engaging.

## Features

- **AI-driven responses:** Get intelligent answers about Paris attractions, routes, and must-see artworks.
- **User-friendly interface:** Designed for easy interaction and quick access to travel insights.
- **Concise information:** All responses are limited to 100 tokens for clarity and brevity.

## How It Works

1. Users input travel-related questions.
2. The AI processes each question using a custom system prompt.
3. Responses are generated and displayed, enhancing the travel planning experience.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies (`openai`).
3. Add your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.
4. Run the notebook to interact with the AI travel guide.

## Example Questions

- How far away is the Louvre from the Eiffel Tower (in miles) if you are driving?
